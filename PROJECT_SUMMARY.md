# Project File Summary

Based on my analysis of your project files, here's a comprehensive summary of what each file does:

## Configuration Files

1. **package.json**
   - Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts
   - Main dependencies: Express, Supabase, Zod (validation), JWT (authentication)
   - Scripts for development, building, and running the application

2. **tsconfig.json**
   - TypeScript configuration for the project
   - Defines compiler options and included/excluded files

3. **.env.example**
   - Template for environment variables needed by the application
   - Includes placeholders for Supabase credentials and other settings

4. **railway.json**
   - Railway deployment configuration
   - Set to use DOCKERFILE as the builder

5. **nixpacks.toml**
   - Alternative configuration for Railway's Nixpacks builder
   - Defines build and start commands for the TypeScript application

6. **Dockerfile**
   - Container definition for Docker-based deployment
   - Uses multi-stage build to optimize the final image
   - Builds TypeScript code and runs the compiled JavaScript

## Core Application Files

7. **src/server.ts**
   - Main application entry point
   - Sets up Express middleware (CORS, Helmet, Morgan, etc.)
   - Configures routes and error handling
   - Includes debugging for environment variables
   - Binds to 0.0.0.0 to accept connections from all network interfaces

8. **src/services/supabase.ts**
   - Creates and configures the Supabase client
   - Includes fallback mock implementation when credentials are missing
   - Provides helper functions for error handling and response formatting

9. **src/routes/api.ts**
   - Main API router that mounts all other route modules
   - Includes routes for case studies, blog posts, profile, contact, and admin
   - Provides a simple health check endpoint at /api/health

10. **src/controllers/**
    - Contains controller logic for different resources
    - Implements CRUD operations using Supabase
    - Includes controllers for blog posts, case studies, contact, and profile

11. **src/schemas/**
    - Defines Zod validation schemas for request data
    - Ensures data integrity before processing

12. **src/middleware/**
    - Contains middleware functions for authentication and validation
    - Validates requests against schemas
    - Handles authentication using JWT

## Deployment and Testing Files

13. **start.sh**
   - Shell script to start the application
   - Handles environment variable loading and debugging
   - Attempts to create and run debug-env.js
   - Starts the main server

14. **debug-env.js**
   - Debugging script for environment variables
   - Logs environment variables with sensitive information masked

15. **test-api.sh** and **test-railway-deployment.sh**
   - Shell scripts to test API endpoints after deployment
   - Verify that the application is running correctly

16. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md**
   - Documentation for deploying the application to Railway
   - Includes steps for configuration and troubleshooting

## Current Deployment Strategy

The project now uses a Docker-based deployment strategy with a multi-stage build:

1. Build stage: Compiles TypeScript code to JavaScript
2. Production stage: Runs the compiled JavaScript with only production dependencies

This approach provides several benefits:
- Smaller final image size
- Clear separation between build and runtime dependencies
- Consistent builds across different environments

## Deployment Issues

The main issue appears to be with the Railway deployment, which consistently fails with a 502 error and the message "Application failed to respond." Despite multiple approaches to fix this issue, including:

1. Fixing server binding to listen on all network interfaces
2. Adding a root route for health checks
3. Optimizing the build process
4. Creating debug scripts to diagnose environment variable issues

The application still fails to start properly on Railway. The logs show errors related to missing the debug-env.js module, suggesting there might be issues with how Railway is handling the deployment or file paths.
